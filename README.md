I work fulltime in corporate IT and always end up with these titles:

- Technical architect (design of distributed solutions)
- System architect (mostly distributed systems)
- Infrastructure architect (from DC layout to machines, network, storage)
- Cloud engineer (all major hyperscaler)
- System engineer (mostly Linux solutions, rarely embedded)
- Kubernetes expert (using K8S since 2017 in version 1.5)
- Linux expert (only an admin, no kernel developer)
-- vim > emacs, low-latency > mainline, sed/awk <3
- Security engineer (application, system and infrastructure security)

I am focused on cluster and distributed systems in corporate/enterprise environments and sometimes I like to code in C, C++, Golang (or recently Flutter). Since I have a strong infrastructure and administrator background I do a lot of automizing and scripting.

I am not a professional programmer but I like code!
