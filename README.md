I work fulltime and always end up with these titles:

- Technical architect
- System architect
- Infrastructure architect
- Cloud engineer
- System engineer
- Kubernetes expert
- Linux expert
- Security engineer

I am focused on cluster and distributed systems in corporate/enterprise environments and sometimes I like to code in C, C++, Golang (or recently Flutter) :)

I am not a professional programmer!
